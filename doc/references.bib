abstract = {A structure refinement method is described which does not use integrated neutron powder intensities, single or overlapping, but employs directly the profile intensities obtained from step-scanning measurements of the powder diagram. Nuclear as well as magnetic structures can be refined, the latter only when their magnetic unit cell is equal to, or a multiple of, the nuclear cell. The least-squares refinement procedure allows, with a simple code, the introduction of linear or quadratic constraints between the parameters.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {We argue that it is not too early to begin the planning process for a next generation neutron source for Europe, even as the European Spallation Source is being constructed. We put forward three main arguments. Firstly, nowadays the period between the first scientific concept of a new facility being proposed and its actual realisation is approaching half a century. We show evidence for this. Secondly, there is a straightforward development of the short pulse/long pulse spallation concepts that will deliver gains in neutron brightness of more than a factor 30 over what the ESS will soon deliver and provide the optimum balance between resolution and intensity. We describe our concept, which is a spallation source where the proton pulse length is matched to the moderating time of slow neutrons. Thirdly, when we look at our colleagues in astronomy and high energy physics, we see that they have a totally different, more global and more ambitious approach to the coming generations of large facilities. We argue that it is time for the neutron community not simply to rest upon its laurels and take what is given but to be proactive..}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the basic theory of neutron scattering and examples of applications, with the aim of elucidating the wide variety of problems in condensed-matter research that can be studied with this technique. The neutron is a subatomic particle with zero charge, mass m = 1.0087 atomic mass units, spin 1/2, and magnetic moment μn = - 1.9132 nuclear magnetons. These four properties combine to make the neutron a highly effective probe of condensed matter. The zero charge means that its interactions with matter are confined to the short-ranged nuclear and magnetic interactions, which in turn has two important consequences: the interaction probability is small, so the neutron can usually penetrate into the bulk of a sample of condensed matter and, as it can also be described in terms of the first Born approximation and thus given in explicit form by quite simple formulas. Different kinds of atomic and molecular excitations in condensed matter are discussed. The chapter discusses the three special applications of nuclear scattering: quasi-elastic scattering, small-angle scattering, and diffuse scattering. These applications are characterized by the nature of the scattering in terms of the distribution of the scattering function over the wave vector and energy-transfer variables, rather than by specific scientific areas to which they are being applied. In fact, each of these applications covers a variety of scientific areas. The chapter also discusses the nuclear spin ordering.}
