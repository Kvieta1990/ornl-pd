MantidTotalScattering (MTS) is a total scattering data reduction routine which wraps up a series of [Mantid](https://mantidproject.org/) algorithms for reducing the neutron total scattering data. Here at SNS, ORNL, we have already put the MTS data reduction framework into practical use for the total scattering data processing, for both [NOMAD](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/nomad) and [POWGEN](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/powgen). From a high-level view, we believe that as long as the neutron events data files are stored in the NeXus format and are compatible with the [Mantid](https://mantidproject.org/) framework, we should be able to use MTS for any time-of-flight (TOF) instruments. Here, by 'compatible', we mean the instrument geometry, sample logs, etc. are incorporated in the data NeXus files and are readable by [Mantid](https://mantidproject.org/). On the user side, MTS takes in a single JSON file as the input which contains all the information needed for running the data reduction. The information includes the raw data file(s), the calibration file (in `HDF5` format, containing the calibration constants for TOF-$$d$$ conversion), those characterization files (empty container, empty instruments and vanadium measurements), the sample & vanadium specific information (composition, geometry, etc.), and among other necessary information.
