There are multiple ways to make contribution to the book or make any comments on the book.

## Option-1

Get in touch [Dr. Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang) who is the main developer and maintainer of the book. More detailed contact information can be found [here](https://iris2020.net/contact/).

## Option-2

If you are using GitHub ![github](./imgs/github.png), you can consider the GitHub option to make comments or contributions. In fact, this is a more straightforward way and by fully leveraging the issue tracking and version control capability of GitHub, we can manage the comments and content changes more robustly.

- To make contributions, click on the ![github](./imgs/github.png) icon on the top right corner of the page and then click on `Suggest edit` to head over to the source codes on GitHub. One may need to email [Dr. Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang) to be added to the project to make contributions.

- To make comments, again, click on the ![github](./imgs/github.png) icon on the top right corner of the page and then click on `Open issue`. Opening an issue `does not` require one to be added to the project.
