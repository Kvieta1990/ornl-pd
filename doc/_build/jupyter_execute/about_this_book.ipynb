    "This book was generated with the [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) technology is for hosting the comprehensive introduction about the powder diffraction at ORNL. It covers a wide range from the underlying principles and tools available for data reduction, tutorials & demonstration for performing data reduction, to useful information and necessary input files from instruments for performing the powder diffraction data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) technology, the book could be generated from simple markdown (a simple language for generating HTML-like formatted web contents) files, and more interestingly (and importantly), from Jupyter notebooks. With Jupyter notebooks, the generated web page can be made interactive so that one does not have to leave the page to execute a certain snippet of codes. Such a binding technology makes the book both knowledge and interactivity oriented, so that readers can read about the contents and play around with the underlying operations, at the same time and in the same scope.\n",

    "To demonstrate the interaction with the book, we include the following the same piece of demo code as given in the [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/interactive/thebe.html) documentation. To execute the code below, one needs to click on ![launcher](./imgs/launcher.png) -> `Live Code` button at top of the web page. The web host will then set up the live environment through [Binderhub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) connection, which may take ~1 minute. When the environment is ready, you should be able to see `Launching from mybinder.org: ready` at the top of the web page. Then click on the code snippet as below and press [Shift]+[Enter] to execute the code. Or, one can use the `run`, `restart`, and `restart & run all` buttons in the interactive cell (once the `Live Code` environment is ready, you will be able to see those buttons) to interact with the codes. One can also make changes to the code and execute again -- basically, this is a mini environment for executing small pieces of codes interactively."
