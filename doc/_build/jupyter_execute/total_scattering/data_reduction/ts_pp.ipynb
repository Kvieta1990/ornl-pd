    "Usually with the auto-reduced data (see for <a href=\"../../auto_reduce/nomad_auto.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> more) or the manually reduced data (see <a href=\"./dr_howto.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more), one can already perform the total scattering data analysis, using, e.g., the unit-cell baesd approach. Tools available for such analysis can be found <a href=\"../data_analysis/software.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The symmetry constraint on the structural model for such unit-cell based approaches guarantees a limited parameter space, as compared to the degree of freedom of the data. In such a situation, one can safely treat the scale as one of the refinable parameters. However, this is not that much the case for the supercell based approach for total scattering data analysis, such as the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling. With the supercell approach, symmetry constraint will be completely removed after expanding the crystallographic unit cell to a supercell. The model has large number of degrees of freedom and will be driven completely by the data. Although some constraint could be added based on geometrical, physical, or chemical considerations, still the degree of freedom is too large as compared to the total number of data points involved in the modeling, and therefore it is unavoidable one may have the concerns about overfitting. Treating the RMC modeling in a statistical manner, by constructing an ensemble of RMC modeling trials, is a commonly used approach. On the data side, it requires one to treat the data more rigorously, especially concerning the data scaling -- it is always the best practice to try to make sure the data is on an absolute scale, which means the scale of the data and the model is directly comparable without the need for an extra scale factor. This section will cover the post-reduction treatment of the total scattering data and here ***we will be assuming the using of RMCProfile package for the total scattering data modeling***. For details about how to get RMCProfile to work, refer to the link <a href=\"https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/download/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/how-to-launch-rmcprofile-program/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

    "## Data Format Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reciprocal space\n",
    "\n",
    "    In RMCProfile, we follow the convention of defining symbols for various functions as presented in section-2 of Ref. {cite}`dkeents`. It is always strongly recommended that before feeding the data into RMCProfile, we should check the format of the data to see whether it is consistent with what we specify in the input for RMCProfile. For example, in our RMCProfile control file we specify our data format to be \"F(Q)\", that means we are referring our data to be the same format as defined by Eqn. (14) in Ref. [1]. It is noteworthy that in the community, people use the same symbol \"F(Q)\" to represent another format of the reciprocal space data, which is something like $Q[S(Q)-1]$, where S(Q) is the normalized total scattering structure factor as quoted in Eqn. (19-21) in Ref. {cite}`dkeents`. To tell which version of the data that the symbol \"F(Q)\" is representing, we can plot the data and inspect the low-Q region – if it is following our RMCProfile definition, the low-Q level should be somewhat sitting on a flat level (though, in practice it may not be purely flat due to low-Q noise). If it is following the $Q[S(Q)-1]$ definition, the low-Q level should then be sitting on an obvious slope due to the multiplicative $Q$ term in the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Real space\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly in real space, we also need to pay attention to the representation of the same symbol used in the community for different definitions. Again, in RMCProfile, we follow the definition as given in section-2 in Ref. {cite}`dkeents`. For example, when we say our data is in \"G(r)\" format, we mean Eqn. (10) in Ref. {cite}`dkeents`. The asymptotic behavior at low-$r$ and high-$r$ region is accordingly presented in Eqn. (15) in Ref. {cite}`dkeents`. Sometimes, with the same symbol \"G(r)\", one may mean the definition as in Eqn. (43) in Ref. {cite}`dkeents`, e.g., in `pdffit` community. The way to tell which version we mean by \"G(r)\" is similar as above -- we plot the data and inspect the low-$r$ region. If we see our data is sitting on an obvious slope, that means we have the definition as in the `pdffit` community. Otherwise, if the level in the low-$r$ region is somewhat flat, we are following the RMCProfile definition. After all, we need to do the necessary homework to check the data before throwing it into RMCProfile. The fitting engine will take what we tell it as granted and do whatever it can do to fit the data. So, if we tell it something wrong, it can never do it right."

    "Following the definition of discrete Fourier transform (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>, for example), we require the data to be transformed to be sitting on an equally-spaced grid. If our original data is not in such format, we could use the tool `rebin` that is bundled in the RMCProfile package to rebin the data to be equally-space. Usage of this tool is straightforward -- just input the starting and ending points together with the interval following the order as prompted on terminal, it should do the job properly."

The end product we are pursuing here is the normalized total scattering structure factor, which, simply put, should go to $1$ in the high-$Q$ region.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. However, here may come the question that we have two parameters to control the level at high-$Q$. In practice, we can have infinite number of combinations of offset and scale to achieve the same high-$Q$ level. How do we move forward with this? First option is to refer to the low-$r$ behavior in the data output from the Fourier filter step -- `scale_ft.gr` in the example presented above. If the data is scaled properly, we are expecting the Level-1 and Level-2 (see picture down below) to be on the same level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <img src=\"../../imgs/stog_scale.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Quite often, even going through the step above still won’t bring our data to an absolute scale, in which case the only way left is probably to go through the painful trail-and-error process. That means we may want to play around with different scales of the data and see its effect on the fitting. In most cases, if the data scaling is not proper, not refining scale in RMCProfile has little chance to fit the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Alternative option one is to fit scale and offset in RMCProfile, especially for X-ray data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Alternative option two is to fit the scale in, e.g., PDFgui first and use the scale obtained there to rescale our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the `stog_new` tool in the RMCProfile package, one can also use the `pystog` python module (which was developed following the same underlying principle as `stog_new`) for post-processing the total scattering data. The post-processing tab in ADDIE is using `pystog` as the backend engine for the data scaling and Fourier transform (see <a href=\"./dr_howto.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more information). One can refer to the link <a href=\"https://github.com/neutrons/pystog#installation\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for the instruction about installing and using `pystog`. The package was developed in a modular manner so we could build our own Python wrapper script to call those available `pystog` modules. Also, a command-line interface (CLI) `pystog_cli` was developed to take in an input JSON file and the running logic is pretty much similar to the `stog_new` program, as detailed above.
