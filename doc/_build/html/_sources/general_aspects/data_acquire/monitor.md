Data Monitor
===

A web-based data monitoring interface is available to monitor the experiment progress, at [https://monitor.sns.gov](https://monitor.sns.gov).

## Configure PVs To Be Displayed On Monitor

On the instrument landing page, a series of sample logs will be displayed for users to quickly check the status of the experiment and instrument configuration. The sample logs to be displayed are configurable, and here below is a demo video about how to do the configuration in CSS (the frontend interface for instrument control).
