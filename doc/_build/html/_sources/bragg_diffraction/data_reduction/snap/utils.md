# utils 

The snapwrap `utils` module is the main scripting layer for snapwrap and contains the function `reduce` which uses SNAPRed to reduce neutron diffraction data measured on SNAP.

Once imported, its various functions are available as methods, each method will typically have a set of arguments. Wherever possible, these arguments are given sensible defaults so, often times, these need not be specified. However, whenever more complicated, non-standard requirements exist, these are supported by customising the parameters.
