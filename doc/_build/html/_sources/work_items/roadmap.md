Roadmap
===

Keep track of the powder diffraction software development at ORNL, covering the key features implementation & plans, project-level activities, documentation & major updates, and among others, for data reduction and analysis software.

```{admonition} Powder Diffraction Plan Board
:class: hint

The roadmap Kanban board for powder diffraction software development at ORNL is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/users/Kvieta1990/projects/6) for workload management.

To make contribution, get in touch with <a href="mailto:zhangy3@ornl.gov">Yuanpeng Zhang</a>.
```

``````{admonition} Work in Progress
:class: attention

- Powder diffraction data visualization tools and reduction configuration tools development in the ORNL `nova` platform. Here is the production environment, [nova.ornl.gov](https://nova.ornl.gov), and here is the test environment, [nova-test.ornl.gov](https://nova-test.ornl.gov).

- Texture correction for total scattering.

    > Use spherical harmonics to correct for the texture effect. This involves the correction over both the azimuthal and the polar angle. The polar angle bit is tricky as resolution effect is entangled with the potential texture effect.

## Jun-2025

- Automatic calibration job running on instrument machine. This is about the automatic calibration once a diamond run is detected. Due to the proton power upgrade, the strong scatterer diamond would yield more neutron counting than before which would create large file size and thus require large memory for data handling. The autoreducer cannot take such heavy a load and now with this implementation, we managed to tranfer the heavy loaded job of calibration to those instrument machines.

- Beam size definition is now available in the `abs_pre_calc` routine for the pre-calculation of absorption correction.

- User definition of sample and container geometry for absorption correction.

- A chunk-by-chunk Fourier filter routine `pystog_ck` made available to general users on Analysis cluster. This is based on the work by [Prof. Eric Oâ€™Quinn](https://ne.utk.edu/people/eric-oquinn/) and [Dr. Joerg C Neuefeind](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/joerg-c-neuefeind). Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://powder.ornl.gov/data_tools/general.html).

- A hydrogen background removal routine is available on Analysis through `mts_data`. This is a wrapper routine for [EnggEstimateFocussedBackground](https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/EnggEstimateFocussedBackground-v1.html) which estimates the background via a cycling process of applying the top-hat convolution and [CalculatePolynomialBackground](https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/CalculatePolynomialBackground-v1.html) which fits a polynomial function to the estimated background for the purpose of smoothing. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://powder.ornl.gov/data_tools/general.html#mts_data).

## May-2025

- SNS and HFIR instruments monitor mobile apps are available. See the link [here](https://powder.ornl.gov/collections/mobile_apps.html), thanks to the nice work by [Dr. Jie Xing (ORNL)](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/jie-xing).

- For the tools relevant to powder Bragg diffraction or PDF simulation, sometimes the underlying engine (`GSAS-II` for powder Bragg diffraction and `diffpy-CMI` for PDF) would fail to process the uploaded CIF files, due to the flexible nature of the CIF file formatting. We now incorporate `VESTA` as the backend engine to take the uploaded CIF file and export a `VESTA` version of the CIF file, followed by whatever process that users request. With this, we can deal with however formatted CIFs that are compatible with `VESTA`.

## Apr-2025

- Data streaming and caching from live reduction to auto reduction for performance boosting.

    > Process data on live streaming, caching to save processing time at the autoreduction stage when data is ready.

- Consistent way of producing total scattering data on NOMAD and POWGEN, using the [`mantidtotalscattering`](https://github.com/neutrons/mantid_total_scattering) framework.

## Mar-2025

- Some useful routines made available to general users on the analysis cluster for total scattering data post-processing. This includes,

    - `pystog_cli`: the command-line interface for performing Fourier transform, data scaling, etc. for total scattering data. Refer to the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/neutrons/pystog) for detailed information.

    - `mts_data`: the command-line interface for extracting data from the NeXus file produced by `mantidtotalscattering`.

- On POWGEN, we now have the mechanism to automatically restart the livereduction service in case of failure. If the failure still persists after several trials, notification will be sent out to Slack.

- On NOMAD, now even no `abs_pre_calc` was ever performed to collect sample information, we can still move ahead with the autoreduction by filling in some dummy sample information. The reduction won't be rigorous but it will give users the chance to quickly check the data.

- On top of the k-vector search capability, now given a k-vector, GSAS-II can communicate with isodistort for subgroups generation.

- Experimental planning tool available in ADDIE web platform for HB-2A and HB-2C at HFIR. URL: [https://addie.ornl.gov/hfirestimate](https://addie.ornl.gov/hfirestimate).

- Uniform atomic move introduced for RMCProfile package to avoid bias from the cell shape. Proceed to the [RMCProfile website](https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/download) to download the up-to-date package.

- Local web interface for RMCProfile monitor and data & configuration visualization. Proceed to the [RMCProfile website](https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/download) to download the up-to-date package.
