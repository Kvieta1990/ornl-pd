Powder Diffraction Work Items
===

Here we present a collection of ongoing efforts at ORNL on software and tools development to support the neutron scattering data collection, processing, analysis and beyond. Through this page, we intend to show the community with the status of our software development concerning powder diffraction at ORNL. This will benefit general users to track our software development progress with regard to supporting their data processing and analysis. More importantly, such information will better lead general users to those point of contacts in terms of software and tools support.

## Data Reduction

## Data Analysis

- RMCProfile

    > This is a commonly used software for total scattering data analysis. We have part of the development team at ORNL for supporting the software. We will provide continous support to the development of RMCProfile at ORNL. Please refer to our official website for more information, [https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/](https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/). Lead developers at ORNL are [Matt Tucker](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/matthew-g-tucker) and [Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang)
