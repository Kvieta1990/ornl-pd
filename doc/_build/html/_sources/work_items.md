Powder Diffraction Work Items
===

Here we present a collection of ongoing efforts at ORNL on software and tools development to support the neutron scattering data collection, processing, analysis and beyond. Through this page, we intend to show the community with the status of our software development concerning powder diffraction at ORNL. This will benefit general users to track our software development progress with regard to supporting their data processing and analysis. More importantly, such information will better lead general users to those point of contacts in terms of software and tools support.

## Data Reduction

The roadmap for powder diffraction software development at ORNL is hosted on GitHub at [here](https://github.com/users/Kvieta1990/projects/6).

To make contribution, get in touch with <a href="mailto:zhangy3@ornl.gov">Yuanpeng Zhang</a>.

## Data Analysis

- RMCProfile

    > This is a commonly used software for total scattering data analysis. We have part of the development team at ORNL for supporting the software. We will provide continous support to the development of RMCProfile at ORNL. Please refer to our official website for more information, [https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/](https://rmcprofile.ornl.gov/). Lead developers at ORNL are [Matt Tucker](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/matthew-g-tucker) and [Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang)
    
- Spinteract

    > Spinteract is a program for refinement of magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse scattering data collected on powder and single-crystal samples. The lead developer for this program is [Joe Paddison](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/joseph-paddison). Please refer to [this website](https://joepaddison.com/software/) for more information.
    
- Scatty

    > Scatty is a program for ultrafast calculation of diffuse-scattering patterns from atomistic models. The lead developer for this program is [Joe Paddison](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/joseph-paddison). Please refer to [this website](https://joepaddison.com/software/) for more information.
    
- Spinvert

    > Spinvert is a program for refinement of for refinement of atomistic models to powder magnetic diffuse scattering data for frustrated magnets, spin glasses, and other magnetically disordered materials. The lead developer for this program is [Joe Paddison](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/joseph-paddison). Please refer to [this website](https://joepaddison.com/software/) for more information.
    
- GSAS-II

    > There is ongoing effort on the ORNL side to get active involvement in the GSAS-II development. With regard to the powder diffraction, two main contributors are [Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang) and [Joe Paddison](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/joseph-paddison).
    
- Machine learning for phase transition study

    > This is a postdoc project led by [Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang) about using the machine learning algorithm for studying complex phase transition problems. The postdoc working on this project is [Dayton Kizzire](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/dayton-g-kizzire).
    
- Machine learning for neutron total scattering data de-noising

    > This is a SULI project led by [Yuanpeng Zhang](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yuanpeng-zhang) trying to utilize the machine learning algorithm for data denoising for neutron total scattering.
