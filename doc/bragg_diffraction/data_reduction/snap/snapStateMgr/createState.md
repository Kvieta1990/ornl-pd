# `createState`

This is a utilty to instantiate a new state and will create and populate the corresponding folder in `calibration.home`. It has a single required argument: 

`runNumber`, used to look determine the state

Note, if using the deployed version of this code, only instrument scientists with appropriate write permissions can use this utilty. 

## Optional arguments

### `hrn`

The optional parameter `hrn` can be used to specify a "human readable name" for the state. If this is not provided, the string generated by `autoStateName` will be used instead.
