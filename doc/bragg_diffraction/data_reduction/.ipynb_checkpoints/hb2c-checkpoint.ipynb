    "First, one may need to get familiar with the Mantid Workbench framework which will be used for HB-2C powder diffraction data reduction, visualization, and some post-processing. Mantid is commonly used framework for data processing at ORNL and among a few other national facilities around the world. The general user documentation for Mantid framework can be found <a href=\"https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. It is available locally, but users are `strongly recommended` to connect to the <a href=\"https://analysis.sns.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis cluster</a> and the use the installed version of Mantid framework there. The step-by-step instruction for using Mantid with HB-2C data can be found <a href=\"../../pdfs/MantibWorkbench_manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",

    "The data reduction step-by-step instruction can be found in the HB-2C <a href=\"../../pdfs/HB2C_Powder_reduction.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">powder diffraction data reduction manual</a>.\n",

    "For measurement with certain variables scanning through a continuous range, e.g., temperature, measurement time, etc., one can use the event filtering script provided to perform the event filtering operation to slice across the scanning space of the continuous variable. The script is stored in the shared region under the HB-2C directory on analysis cluster. Detailed instructions about using the script can be found <a href=\"../../pdfs/Manual_for_event_filter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Usually, the default script as being used in the instruction above works fine. However, in the case of large number of filtered segments, the overall computational time may reach as long as 1-2 hours, which is not optimal in practice. With this regard, we have created a separate script for performing the event filtering in a parallel manner so the overall computational time could be significantly diminished. The script can be found at `/HFIR/HB2C/shared/WANDscripts/HB2C_filter_parallel.py` and the input section is the same as for the script above."
