Introduction
===

This chapter will focus on the data reduction and analysis for the Bragg diffraction. Detailed instruction and relevant tutorials or demonstration videos will be presented concerning the instrument specific data reduction. Materials about the data analysis (the Rietveld approach) will be covered, including software available and both general and instrument specific tutorials.
